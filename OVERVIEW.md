## 🧭 OVERVIEW — “Prompt Engineering Grandmaster Journey (2025)”

A unified, end-to-end path that merges:

1. **Structured academic training** (like a Coursera/Vanderbilt university course),
2. **Hands-on practice and mastery** (like DeepLearning.AI, Udemy Bootcamps, and Learn Prompting),
3. **Professional-level system design** (like OpenAI’s internal prompt programming and API use).
