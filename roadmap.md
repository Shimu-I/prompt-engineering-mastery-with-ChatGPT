## 🩵 **Phase 1: Foundations of Prompting (Beginner Level)**

### 🎯 Objectives

- Understand what a prompt is, how LLMs interpret text, and why phrasing matters.
- Learn to communicate effectively with ChatGPT and similar models.

### 📚 Topics

1. **How LLMs work** (tokenization, embeddings, attention, context window)
2. **What makes a good prompt** — clarity, constraints, and structure
3. **Types of prompts:**
    - Instructional
    - Conversational
    - Role-based
    - Contextual
4. **Response controls:** temperature, top-p, max tokens, and system prompts
5. **Prompt evaluation basics:** relevance, coherence, and creativity

> 🧠 Outcome: You’ll know how ChatGPT thinks and how to ask for anything precisely.
>

## 🔵 **Phase 2: Core Prompting Techniques (Intermediate Level)**

### 🎯 Objectives

- Master essential prompting frameworks used by OpenAI and DeepLearning.AI.
- Learn to control reasoning, creativity, and tone.

### 📚 Topics

1. **Zero-shot vs Few-shot prompting**
2. **Role prompting & persona design** (e.g., “You are a senior data analyst…”)
3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** and **Step-by-step reasoning**
4. **Self-critique loops** — making the model review its own work
5. **Iterative refinement:** prompt debugging and A/B testing
6. **Prompt patterns (from Vanderbilt University):**
    - Persona Pattern
    - Socratic Pattern
    - Reviewer Pattern
    - Checklist Pattern
    - Meta Prompt Pattern
    - Game-Based Pattern

> 🧠 Outcome: You’ll build precise, context-aware prompts that can handle complex reasoning tasks.
>

## 🟣 **Phase 3: Advanced Prompt Architectures (Professional Level)**

### 🎯 Objectives

- Move from “prompt writing” to *prompt programming.*
- Learn architectures like Tree-of-Thoughts and ReAct used in AI agents.

### 📚 Topics

1. **ReAct (Reason + Act) Framework**
2. **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)** for logical exploration
3. **Self-reflection and self-improvement prompts**
4. **Prompt chaining and memory management**
5. **Output formatting:** JSON, YAML, Markdown, and data parsing
6. **Multi-agent prompting** — having AI models collaborate
7. **Bias mitigation, safety filters, and ethical prompting**

> 🧠 Outcome: You’ll design prompt systems that behave like mini AIs or autonomous reasoning agents.
>
