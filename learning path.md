## 🏛 PART I — Structured 12-Week “University Curriculum”

| **Week** | **Module Title** | **Core Topics** | **Assignments / Projects** | **Mastery Labs (Optional Advanced Work)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | 🧩 *Foundations of LLMs & Prompting* | What LLMs are, tokenization, temperature, system prompts, structure of a good prompt | Write 10 prompts for different goals (creative, analytic, technical) | Analyze token usage and context effects |
| **2** | ✍️ *Prompt Design Fundamentals* | Instruction-based, contextual, and role prompts | Create your first “AI Persona” (e.g., writing coach, code reviewer) | Compare output tone and coherence by tweaking variables |
| **3** | 💬 *Zero-Shot & Few-Shot Prompting* | Demonstrations, examples, guiding model style | Build a prompt “trainer” using few-shot examples | Experiment with 3 different model providers |
| **4** | 🧠 *Chain-of-Thought & Stepwise Reasoning* | CoT prompting, self-consistency, reflection | Build a reasoning prompt for solving logical puzzles | Test with different temperature values and compare results |
| **5** | 🎭 *Prompt Patterns & Personas* | Vanderbilt patterns: Persona, Socratic, Reviewer, Checklist | Design a multi-persona ChatGPT dialogue (teacher vs student) | Integrate self-critique and scoring |
| **6** | ⚙️ *Prompt Debugging & Refinement* | Iterative prompting, constraint tuning, evaluation | Debug and optimize a low-performing prompt | Build your own “prompt checklist” tool |
| **7** | 🧩 *Advanced Architectures: ReAct & ToT* | Reason + Act, Tree-of-Thoughts, multi-agent prompting | Build a reasoning agent using ReAct structure | Simulate multi-step planning with self-feedback |
| **8** | 💻 *Prompt Programming for Developers* | API use, LangChain, variable templating, JSON outputs | Create a mini ChatGPT API app (e.g., resume generator) | Implement prompt version control and scoring |
| **9** | 🧠 *Applied Prompting: Writing, Design, and Business* | Copywriting, storytelling, image prompts, strategy | Build prompts for 3 fields (creative, business, dev) | Combine GPT + Midjourney for multimodal results |
| **10** | 🔄 *Automation & Prompt Libraries* | Prompt templates, macros, system design | Design a “Prompt OS” for personal or business use | Auto-evaluate outputs with Python scripts |
| **11** | 🧩 *Ethics, Bias & Responsible Prompting* | Prompt safety, fairness, jailbreak detection | Write an ethical guideline for prompt engineers | Analyze bias in generated content |
| **12** | 🎓 *Capstone: AI System Design* | Build a real AI assistant using all techniques | Create your own specialized GPT (e.g., TutorGPT, WriterGPT) | Present and optimize your project for real-world use |
