# Prompt Engineering Grandmaster Journey (2025 Edition)

## Overview

The **Prompt Engineering Grandmaster Journey** is a comprehensive professional learning program designed to provide end-to-end mastery of prompt engineering, reasoning architectures, automation, and applied LLM system design.

It consolidates the structure and rigor of a university-style curriculum with the flexibility of a self-paced mastery path, covering all levels—from foundational theory to research-grade application.

This repository contains all materials for the course, including detailed syllabi, learning paths, overviews, and project documentation.

---

## Program Objectives

- Develop a deep understanding of large language models (LLMs) and how they interpret and respond to prompts.
- Build technical skill in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.
- Design advanced architectures including ReAct, Tree-of-Thoughts, and multi-agent reasoning systems.
- Automate and evaluate prompt workflows using APIs, LangChain, and LlamaIndex.
- Integrate multimodal models (text, image, audio, video) into creative and professional pipelines.
- Uphold ethical, responsible, and secure prompt engineering practices.
- Produce deployable prompt-based applications and research-quality systems.
